# Hey there! Let's Get This Show on the Road ðŸš€

*[In Tony Stark voice]*

Alright, let's break this down into something manageable. We're dealing with a sophisticated AI integration framework here - think of it as your personal J.A.R.V.I.S., but with more pizzazz.

## What We're Working With

```mermaid

    A[Your AI Framework] --> B[Convex Backend]
    A --> C[Slack Integration]
    B --> D[AI Providers]
    C --> E[Automation Tools]
    E --> F[n8n/trigger.dev]
```

## Step 1: Convex Setup (The Brain)

```bash
# First, let's get Convex up and running
npx convex dev

# Deploy your functions
npx convex deploy
```

Your Convex deployment will handle:
- Real-time data sync
- AI state management
- Serverless functions

## Step 2: Slack Bot (The Interface)

1. Head to api.slack.com/apps
2. Create New App
3. Add these permissions:
   - chat:write
   - app_mentions:read
   - channels:history
   - im:history

## Step 3: Automation Flow (The Nervous System)

Choose your automation platform:

### Option A: trigger.dev (Recommended)
```typescript
// src/triggers/slack-events.ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

new Trigger({
  id: "slack-message-handler",
  on: "slack:message.created",
  run: async (event) => {
    // Your AI magic here
  }
}).listen();
```

### Option B: n8n (Self-hosted)
- Deploy on your infrastructure
- Create workflows via UI
- Connect Slack + AI endpoints

## Environment Setup

```bash
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL=your_url
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
TRIGGER_DEV_KEY=your-key
```

## Quick Deploy

Just run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Testing the Setup

Send a message to your Slack bot:
```
@your-bot Hey, what's up?
```

If everything's working, you'll get a response faster than I can suit up.

## Monitoring

Watch your baby in action:
- Convex Dashboard: Real-time data
- Slack App Settings: Event logs
- trigger.dev/n8n: Workflow runs

Remember: This isn't just another chatbot - it's a fully integrated AI system. Think less "Hello World" and more "Hello Multiverse".

Need to scale? Just bump up your Convex compute units. It's like adding more arc reactors - more power, more possibilities.

Questions? Just ping the bot. It's like having me around, but with less sarcasm. Maybe.
